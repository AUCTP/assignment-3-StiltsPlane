# Write a function that simulates the daily demand for the product over the next n days using a Poisson distribution.

# Steps:

# Assume the average daily demand (Î») is 20 units.
# Use numpy to generate Poisson-distributed daily demand for n days.
# Analyze the Results:

# Calculate and print the following statistics from the simulation results:
# Mean (average) daily demand
# Standard deviation
# 5th percentile (to understand the lower bound in a worst-case scenario)
# 95th percentile (to understand the upper bound in a best-case scenario)
# Interpret the results in the context of inventory management.
# 2. Inventory Level Simulation
# Determine the optimal inventory level for one month that minimizes the risk of stockouts (running out of stock). Assume that there is no reordering during a month.

# Steps:

# Assume the company wants to maintain a service level of 95%, meaning they want to meet the demand 95% of the time.
# Simulate the total demand for 30 days multiple times (e.g., 1,000 simulations) to understand the distribution of monthly demand.
# Determine the inventory level that would be sufficient to meet the demand 95% of the time.
# Calculate and print the optimal inventory level.
# 3. Optional
# To further enhance your simulation, consider the following improvement:

# Create a user interface to input different assumptions (e.g., average daily demand, service level).
